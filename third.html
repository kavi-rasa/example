        <p>Driven by a desire to travel and explore this beautiful nation, I had begun a quest to visit every fort along our coastal belt. These amazing fortified structures have withstood time itself, and have a history of their own. The better-known forts are found in Galle, Matara, Jaffna, Kalpitiya and Trincomalee. I have visited all of them. Smaller forts and stockades were built by the Dutch in Negombo, Kelaniya, Colombo, Kalutara, Malwana, Hanwella, Seethawaka and Ruwanwella. Today, there are no traces of some of these magnificent buildings. But in the quiet fishing hamlet of Karainagar in the Northern Province stands a unique fort known as Fort Hammenhiel. It is the only fort surrounded on all sides by the ocean, and obviously has no landside access as some of the bigger forts. This would have been a vital defence strategy in that era.
            <br>The causeway that leads to Mandaithivu is dotted with green nets on either side as local fishermen have mastered the art of rearing prawns. Early next morning we began our journey towards Karainagar. This island is connected by a long causeway to the mainland. The view from either side of the causeway is refreshing, as small fishing boats meandered on the waterway. Marine birds flew about in their hundreds.

                    <br>
                   <P>About 15km away from the city of Jaffna is the white sandy beach known as ‘Charty Beach’, a beautiful little spot far from noise and crowds commonly found at the more popular beaches of Sri Lanka. Due to the Civil War, the beach had remained vastly untouched until after it ended. Today, you can find many resorts a short distance away from it, making it a great remote beach vacation area.
                       <br>Palm and coconut trees line the shore like markers of a tropical paradise, and the almost always sunny weather at this beach ensures you can get that tan without a worry! Little huts also dot the beach, so if you need to get away from the sun and rest in the shade, you could always hop into one.
                       <br>Vendors have set up shop away from the shore, selling numerous local delicacies, so don’t hesitate to drop by a stall and try some exquisite Sri Lankan street food! If you’re eager to take a dip, feel free to dive right in! Charty Beach has plenty of changing rooms, so getting drenched is no problem at all.
                       <br>The picturesque beach combines sapphire blue waters with stunning white sand to paint an exotic view that is certain to heal your soul and please your eyes. Charty Beach has all the amenities minus the large crowds, so it’s ideal for those who would like to take a break from the crowds and just chill with the waves.

                    <br>
                    <br><p>The remotest of Sri Lanka's inhabited islands is Delft, which is situated in the Gulf of Mannar to the north-northwest of mainland Sri Lanka and to the south-southwest of Jaffna peninsula. Delft Island is a Divisional Secretariat of Jaffna District in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.
                        <br>Besides the natural beauty of the sparsely populated island and some ruins of a fortress buildings, there are few attractions for travellers - but they are somewhat strange ones, namely first and foremost Sri Lanka's only herds of feral horses, descendants of Arabian stallions once breeded here for horse trade with India; secondly an imposing specimen of a Baobab tree, a typical species of subsaharan Africa, which is a rare sight in Sri Lanka. All landmarks of Delft Island – the buildings, the animals and the tree - are legacies of European colonial history.
                        <br>The Dutch city name "Delft" is the common Sinhalese designation of the island, although the Sinhala language otherwise avoids the articulation of three consonants and does not use the ending "lft". Of course, there is a traditional Tamil name as well, "Neduntivu", also spelt "Neduntheevu", which translates to "long island" or "large island". But Sri Lankans of all ethnicities still use - or at least understand - the word "Delft". Even on renowned international nautical maps, e.g, the Admiralty Charts issued by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, the island is cartographed as "Delft".

                            <p align="justify">Akkarai Beach is situated in Thondamanaru in the Jaffna district. It is the ideal beach to spend a day out with family and is ideal for swimming as well. There is a bridge located close to the beach and it is surrounded by lush greenery which adds to the beauty of the area. It is a nature-friendly place with many sail boats and yachts to be seen out in the sea.
                                <br>Those who are dreaming of moving out for a weekend holiday in a beach place for them Akkarai beach is the best choice. It hardly takes 40 minutes to drive here from the center of Jaffna. Akkarai beach is located in Thondamanaru, Jaffna which is a district of the Sri Lankan Northern Province. It is among the best beaches near Jaffna and will be a great time for those who are planning to have a trip here.
                                <br>This beach is among the best Jaffna beaches in Sri Lanka and is the perfect choice for the family visit, as it will surely make your day There is a gorgeous bridge near Akkarai beach which gives the travelers an anxious feeling while approaching it. After reaching the top of the bring, the greenery across the beach and a vast range of creators can be distinctly seen. And there is one of the prominent lord Murugan temples in Sri Lanka near this beach. This is a great place for the children’s to play and have fun, or we can call it as the children park. There are plenty of yachts in this sea. I suggest this beach is a great place for spending a relaxing and mind freshening tour.
                                <br>Since the Akkarai beach is not very much popular and its beauty is still out of the vision of travelers from across the globe that makes it a quiet calm and peaceful place.

                                Amazingly gorgeous beach not overcrowded like the other beaches in the Jaffna. It is a very clean place with a huge peace of mind where the visitors can feel the pleasure of a peaceful and calm environment. It is a very nature-friendly place, and you will not see any plastic waste.
