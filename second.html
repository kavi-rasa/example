            </font></p>  
            <P>  The majestic stronghold of our colonial north</p>
                <br><p color="black">Originally built by the Portuguese in the 17th century, the Jaffna Fort is one of Sri Lanka’s last well-preserved colonial ramparts. Sprawled over the southeastern edge of the northern capital, the Jaffna Fort owes much of its grandeur to the Dutch who captured it from the Portuguese, and later expanded it into the landmark we see today. Following the departure of the Dutch, the British also used the Jaffna Fort as a stronghold until Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948. Today, the Jaffna Fort is a popular attraction for all visitors to the city, with open grounds and century-old walls that can be scaled upon as you take in the views of Jaffna around you.<br>Located a short walk away from Jetwing Jaffna, the city’s historical fort stands tall over its bordering lagoon, overlooking the Kayts Causeway leading up to the peninsular island of the same name. The Jaffna Fort is especially welcoming closer to sunset, when accompanied by a cool ocean breeze and pinkish-orange skies of northern Sri Lanka.</p>

            <p>Jaffna Fort, the second biggest Dutch fort built in Sri Lanka is an archaeological monument that has had a direct onslaught as a result of the recent 30 year of armed conflict. Although a portion of its seaside rampart had been destroyed due to a continuous offensive from the LTTE the fort taken as a whole has not undergone a severe destruction. An outer moat exists outside the ramparts. Outside the moat is the outer rampart which has built in to it five tunnels each in a twin formation. Although the tunnels are in good preservation they are presently void of doors. However they show signs that they have had doorways in the past.
                <br>
                The monuments within the fort had been destroyed during the conflict that raged in the area. Of these the monument named the Queen’s Palace is in sufficient level of preservation than the rest as it could be identified. Its superstructure is completely destroyed and the remaining walls are in the process of being destroyed due to the presence of invasive plants having taken roots in them.
            <br>
            <br>The short parapet wall constructed to the style of Dutch architecture in front of this building has by and large been spared of destruction. Behind the building is an access to the rampart with an ornate trellis balustrade. This access may have been used by the Dutch to transport arms to the rampart. There is evidence to show that a verandah with two ponds of the Dutch architectural style had existed in front of the Queen’s Palace.
        <br>
        <br>The Dutch church located within the fort had been bombed and completely destroyed. As this structure had been documented its ancient layout could be identified. Its broad walls had been constructed in limestone.

        The other buildings such as the old prison, the hospital and the ancillary buildings have undergone much destruction. The belfry on the inner rampart is similar to those found in other Dutch forts. Presently their walls are missing.
    <br>
    <br>Close to the boundary of the seaside rampart are a well believed to have been constructed during the Dutch era and a Hindu temple built at a later date.</p>

            <br>
            <p>First built in 1933, the Jaffna Library has long been a symbol of northern heritage. Emphasised by its now restored classical architecture, the library also endured a horrific burning in 1981 – a time at which it held nearly 100,000 books and manuscripts, making it one of the largest libraries in Asia. Ancient literature and documents from renowned scholars and other professionals were preserved at the Jaffna Library, and served as a cherished depository for information on the history and culture of the northern peninsula. Today, although filled with a collection nowhere near its original, the Library still commands the timeless dignity it upholds for the people of Jaffna and beyond.
                <br>
                <br> Mere minutes away from Jetwing Jaffna, the Jaffna Library is a pleasant escape in the early evening, before it closes at 6 PM. As a sign of respect to the culture preserved by this iconic building, visitors must remove their footwear before entering the library. Although most wings are inaccessible to walk-in travellers, you are still able to explore the public areas of the library, along with the beautiful garden that adorns its grounds

                    <h3 class="heading">CASAUARINA BEACH JAFFNA</h3> 
                    </font></p>
                    <P>Jaffna Peninsula is blessed number good beaches.Casuarina Beach is in Karainagar, Jaffna District, Sri Lanka, about 20 kilometers far from Jaffna. The Casuarina Beach in Karainagar is also called and written as Casoorina, Cashoorina and few additional variants. This is said to be the most excellent beach in the Jaffna Peninsula. One can walk a long way in the deep blue water with calm waves touching towards the land. The beach lies on the north of Karativu island, one of the largest island in the peninsula which is joined to the mainland over a causeway.
                        <br>
                        The beach probably got its name due the Casuarina Trees are grown along the beach. The beach lies about 20 km off Jaffna and may take about 45 minutes to travel by a vehicle. This beach is very different from the other beaches found in Sri Lanka. The sand has a unique color. Shallow water, no waves, can go a long space toward the sea and a very safe place to have a bath. The fisherman in the area use kind of a flat boat made out of wooden logs which resembles a full boat cut in half. These are used to fish in shallow waters and go about prawn farms in the sea. The beach itself is pretty different to a normal Sri Lanka beach. Since this is a very popular beach in Jaffna you get some shops here with food, handicrafts.
