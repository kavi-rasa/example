            <p align="justify">A hugely significant region steeped in rich Hindu-Tamil history and culture, the city of Jaffna is bursting with tradition and colour. Jaffna is the main city of Jaffna District which is situated in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Multicoloured temples, lusciously green palms, friendly Tamil people, welcome travellers and tourists into their lives with positivity and curiosity
            <br>
            The distance between Colombo to Jaffna is 363.2 km. Arriving in Jaffna can come as a culture to the naive, and it is impossible to miss the profound Indian influence notable by the gradual switch from the intoned accents of Sinhala to the quick-fire tones of Tamil. Yet the town has its own unique and complex identity shaped by a wide cross-section of ethnicities, including Muslim, Portuguese, Dutch, British and Sinhalese, with colourful temples set next to huge churches, and streets dotted with ancient Dutch and British residences.</p>

        <p align="justify">Due to a 30 year long civil war, it was a closed destination to many and since then it has risen from the ashes to be an exceptional city with a uniqueness that sets it apart from the rest of the island. Jaffna is certainly the hub of the vibrant Tamil culture in Sri Lanka yet blended with the colonial charm from a bygone era.
         <br>
         
         The Jaffna Dutch Fort is the second largest fort in Sri Lanka. The Nallur Kovil, Jaffna Fort, Jaffna Library, Archaeological Museum, Point Pedro, Keerimalai Hot Springs, Casuarina Beach are some of the top places to see. Sail out to Delft Island and see the wild horses left by the Portuguese in the 16th century and other little islands left with historical heritage.</p>

    <p align="justify">Sri Lanka’s historical records reveal that there had been several invasions by the South Indians. The best known victory was by the Sinhalese King Dutugemunu of Anuradhapura who had defeated the Tamil leader Elara in the 2nd century BC. From 1200 BC the Tamils had built inroads into the northern part of the island and by 1400 they were self sufficient to form a kingdom in Jaffna. Therefore for many centuries, the city of Jaffna was Sri Lanka’s Hindu-Tamil cultural and religious pride until Jaffna was destabilised and fell to the Portuguese colonists in 1619. The Portuguese had captured King Sangli of Jaffna Kingdom and destroyed all the Hindu temples in the city. Many Christian conversions had taken place hence the presence of all the beautiful churches. Most of the temples were not rebuilt until the 19th century. Jaffna was taken over by the Dutch in 1658 after a tedious and bitter siege of three months. There are several Portuguese and Dutch fortifications which are in ruins today that remain stippled across the city. Eventually the British took over Jaffna in 1795.<br>
        <br>
    In the early 1980’s there was ethnic unrest and a civil war broke out in 1983 which went on for 30 long years and during that period the city became a no-go war zone. As a result of the war, the city lost most of its population since most of the people had migrated overseas. Through the years, Jaffna somehow survived the endless bombings and disaster and sprang back to life when peace prevailed as the war ended in 2009.</p> <br>
